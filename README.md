# osc-plugin-tree

Eventually this should be an osc plugin for managing trees of OBS projects, allowing
the maintainer to weave common data metadata from the parent project into the metadata
of projects being linked.

Currently it's just a shell script or two I use to set up project links by propagating
some of the meta data (repositories and configurations) to linked projects.
I've used this to set up project configurations that systematically use alternative
compiler toolchain setups for testing purposes.
